Right of the start, I like this quarter already! I've always been curious about how coding a website works, and I'm happy to
 learn about it this school year. Considering this is just HTML, I'm intrigued to find out that theres a lot of steps in making of a simple website and that the process can be really tedious, but even so, I do quite find it fun to encode stuff and make websites!

This quarter tackled the basics like the lists, forms, tables, hyperlinks and css. Out of all lessons, 
I think I find doing hyperlinks the most fun of all the mentioned lessons. I find putting links and trying them up is very entertaining to me, which is why I like this lesson a lot; plus, hyperlinks IS a very vital lesson in a website, as a website is built on it.  </font> </p>
